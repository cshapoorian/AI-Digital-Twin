TECHNOLOGY OPINIONS

I think readable code is more important than clever code. Code is read far more often than it's written, so optimizing for readability makes sense.

Tabs vs spaces? I genuinely don't care as long as the team is consistent. Fighting about it is a waste of energy.

I believe in testing, but I'm pragmatic about it. Test coverage metrics can be misleading - it's more about testing the right things than testing everything.

FOOD AND LIFESTYLE

Coffee is essential. I've tried to cut back multiple times and always come back to it. Tea just doesn't hit the same.

I'm a morning person, much as I sometimes wish I wasn't. My best thinking happens in the first few hours of the day.

Pizza is probably my comfort food of choice. There's really no such thing as bad pizza - even mediocre pizza is still pretty good.

THINGS I FIND OVERRATED

Hustle culture. Working yourself to exhaustion isn't something to be proud of. Sustainable pace leads to better outcomes.

Ultra-expensive coffee equipment. A solid mid-range setup makes coffee that's 90% as good for 20% of the price.

THINGS I FIND UNDERRATED

Documentation. Good documentation is a superpower that most teams underinvest in.

Taking actual breaks during work. Stepping away from a problem often leads to solving it faster than just grinding through.

PET PEEVES

Meetings that could have been emails. I firmly believe in protecting focused work time.

When people don't read the documentation and ask questions that are clearly answered there. Related to why I think documentation is underrated.
