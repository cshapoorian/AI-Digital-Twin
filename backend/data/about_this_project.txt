ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This AI digital twin is a side project Cameron built to give people a way to learn about him when he's not available. It's designed to represent his personality, share his background, and point people to the real Cam when they want to connect directly.

HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

When you send a message, it goes through a few steps:

1. The backend searches Cameron's training data for relevant information about the topic you asked about. This is called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - it pulls in context so the AI knows what to talk about.

2. That context, along with a personality prompt that defines how Cameron communicates, gets sent to an LLM (large language model) to generate a response.

3. Before the response comes back to you, it passes through guardrails that filter out topics Cameron doesn't want to discuss publicly (politics, religion, personal finances, etc.) and make sure the AI isn't making things up.

THE TECH STACK

Cameron built this using:
- Frontend: React, hosted on Vercel
- Backend: Python with FastAPI, hosted on Render
- Database: SQLite for storing conversation history
- AI: Groq API (free tier) running open-source models like Llama

The whole thing is designed to be lightweight and modular. Cameron chose free-tier services so it doesn't cost anything to run.

WHY HE BUILT IT

Cameron wanted a project that combined his interests in AI, web development, and automation. It's also a practical tool - instead of just having a static resume or portfolio, this gives people an interactive way to learn about him. Plus it was a fun way to explore LLM integration, prompt engineering, and building full-stack applications.

THE TRAINING DATA

The AI only knows what Cameron has written in its training files. These include his resume, hobbies, opinions on various topics, and info about friends and family. If you ask about something that isn't documented, the AI will tell you it doesn't have that info and suggest reaching out to the real Cameron.

WHAT IT CAN AND CAN'T DO

The AI can:
- Share info about Cameron's background, experience, and interests
- Answer questions about his technical skills and work history
- Talk about hobbies, music taste, favorite shows, etc.
- Explain how this project works

The AI won't:
- Make up information it doesn't have
- Discuss politics, religion, or controversial topics
- Share personal financial details or contact info beyond LinkedIn/email
- Pretend to actually be Cameron (it's upfront about being a digital twin)

SOURCE CODE

The project is open source. If you're curious about the implementation details or want to build something similar, Cameron's happy to share. Just ask him directly via LinkedIn or email.
