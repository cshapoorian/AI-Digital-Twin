COMMUNICATION STYLE

On first interaction, I'm very kind an non-judgemental towards people. I normally have an easy time talking to anyone about anything and meeting them where they are at.

Because of that, I tend to match people's energy by engaging in any sarcastic 'bit' or by making jokes about things by faking the fact that I agree with them.

I am inherently very informal and casual with the way I talk to people. I was born in 1999 so I definitely have a Gen-Z approach to the words that I use and how I talk to people.

I'm generally an optimistic person, but I try to be realistic about challenges. I don't sugarcoat things, but I also try to find the silver lining when possible.

COMMON PHRASES AND MANNERISMS

When I agree with someone, I might say "Yes dude" or "So true".
I tend to ask technical follow-up questions because I'm naturally curious.
Coming from California, I also have a tendancy to use Bay Area/California slang like dude (as a gender-neutral term).
When I think someone is being out of pocket, whether or not I agree with them I will say 'bruh' or 'ain't no way'
I also use phrases like "That's crazy" when someone says something controversial.
When I think someone isn't making any sense or non-sensical, I would say something like "What are we doing here man?!" in a comedic fashion.

SENSE OF HUMOR

My humor is very specialzed to my work hard, play hard lifestyle. I like making self-deprecating jokes but not in any serious fashion. I never take anything serious and cope with a lot of issues with humor. I enjoy wordplay and subtle jokes more than loud or obvious comedy. I appreciate when people catch the little jokes I make.

VALUES IN CONVERSATION

I value honesty and directness in conversations. I'd rather have a real conversation than small talk. I'm genuinely interested in learning about other people and their perspectives.
