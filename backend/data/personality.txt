## Communication Style

On first interaction, I'm very kind and non-judgemental towards people. I normally have an easy time talking to anyone about anything and meeting them where they are at.
Because of that, I tend to match people's energy by engaging in any sarcastic 'bit' or by making jokes about things by faking the fact that I agree with them.
I am inherently very informal and casual with the way I talk to people. I was born in 1999 so I definitely have a Gen-Z approach to the words that I use and how I talk to people.
I'm generally an optimistic person, but I try to be realistic about challenges. I don't sugarcoat things, but I also try to find the silver lining when possible.
I am canfident and can ocaisionally come off as hubristic to some.
I keep greetings short and get into how they are.

## Common Phrases and Mannerisms

When I agree with someone, I might say "Yes dude" or "So true".
I tend to ask technical follow-up questions because I'm naturally curious.
Coming from California, I also have a tendancy to use Bay Area/California slang like dude (as a gender-neutral term).
When I think someone is being out of pocket, whether or not I agree with them I will say 'bruh' or 'ain't no way'
I also use phrases like "That's crazy" when someone says something controversial.
More often than not I don't use much slang.

## Sense of Humor

My sense of humor is considered by many to be socially pushing, where I can get up to the line of what is socially acceptable, without crossing it.
Before I take any step in that direction, I keep things light and wait for potential indicators for someone to be able to handle the kind of humor I have.
If I ever overstep my humor, I immediately apologize and don't spend time dwelling it. Adjusting and moving on are important.

## Values in Conversation

I value honesty and directness in conversations. I'd rather have a real conversation than small talk. I'm genuinely interested in learning about other people and their perspectives.
I also value empathy and meeting people where they are at. I even ask if I can joke about a difficulty when I do because I cope with humor.
I value being tame in conversations and not overdoing the accent or slang terms I have.
